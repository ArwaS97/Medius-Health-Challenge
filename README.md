Medius Health Data Science Challenge 

By Arwa Siddiqui

#### Data Description: 
1. Dataset is provided in “data” folder. Each file in the data folder is considered as a document.
2. There are 300 documents.
3. Each document has some text information.

#### Task Description: 
Grouping documents with the same semantic description into clusters. 
1. Process the text data in each document/file using NLP, data processing, text mining.
3. Develop a model to partition the data into multiple clusters. It is required to develop the end-to-end model in python instead of using any data clustering libraries or pre-trained models.

The **outcome** of the model: 
1. Number of clusters and the data points in each cluster. 
2. Report the number of clusters found in the data.
3. Find out the topics of each cluster. (You can run any benchmark off-the-shelf topic modelling algorithm like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or PLSA)
4. If possible, visualize the cluster.
